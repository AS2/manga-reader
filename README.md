## Rules for git workflow
+ 'main' is the main branch of the project. 
At the end of each sprint all the work from the 'develop' branch goes to 'main'. Only the tech lead can make changes to the 'main' branch

+ 'develop' is the branch that stores working versions with changes during each sprint. Only the tech lead has the right to change this branch and only in extreme cases.
Most of the changes are done through the merge operation of the feature_<name> branches by the tech lead.
